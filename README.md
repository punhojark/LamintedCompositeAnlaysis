## Structural Analysis Tool for Laminated Composites
> Authors: Junho Park (parkjunho0624@gmail.com)

Predicted and modeled mechanical behaviors of different composite structures (i.e. glass-epoxy) using Classical Lamination Theory and different failture criteria such as Tsai-Hill and Tsai-Wu failure criteria. 

Objectives:
* Calculate the stress-strain values of composite structures under certain thermomechanical loading (elongation, compression, thermal load)
* Calculate the failure indexes (Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill) of composites under thermomechanical loading

## How-To-Use
1. Use 'Input.txt' to input material characteristics (i.e. thickness, E, G, poisson's ration etc.) and thermomechancial loading situation and save it. 
2. Run 'Laminate_Analysis.m'
3. Check 'Output.txt' file to check for appropriate values.
